# #  **Custom Domains for Github Blogs:**

This week I will be working on collecting resources on why custom domain names are becoming popular when creating blog pages on GitHub


GitHub Pages are a convinient and quick way to publish blogs, weather they are personal or professional.
GitHub Pages supported [custom domains](http://https://github.blog/2009-01-21-cname-support-for-github-pages/ "custom domains")   and are a great tool to create beautiful sites.

###  Getting you desired domain name

There are different ways of getting the domain name. CNAME or ALIAS can be accesable over HTTPS and will support correct loading of the site over HTTPS.

### Steps to take to prepare GitHub for Custom Domain

On GitHub, go to the Settings page of your new repository, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and enable it by selecting a Source. After you refresh the page, you should see a green success banner that tells you this repository is now published at http://deanattali.com/MyCoolProject.
